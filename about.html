                Pleasant Good Day! My name is Michael Byfield. I'm currently attending the University of Technology, Jamaica.
                Sitting my final year as a cybersecurity student. 
            </p>
            <p> My goal is to specialize in the field of computer forensics after I grew interest from a class I was in
                that was taught by Mr. Linton. However, with little to no experience, what I've learnt from the classes
                helped to guide me where computing forensics is concerned. As such I will use that knowledge to 
                my adavantage.
                
               
            </p>
            <p> My target focus is straight forward. With my knowledge on forensics, I will aid in discovering bad actors 
                and evidence to apprehend such threats. This will leave a positive impact throughout the world.
                My hobbies include but are not limited to; reading, playing football or watching a movie.
